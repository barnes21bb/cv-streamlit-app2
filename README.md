# Streamlit Video Annotation Tool (Workspace Scaffold)

This repository is the starting point for a modular Streamlit-based video annotation tool for computer vision. It will support multi-user/project management, persistent storage, interactive annotation (bounding boxes), and model training/export.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository and create a Python virtual environment.
2. Install dependencies (requirements.txt will be provided as development progresses).
3. Run the Streamlit app using `streamlit run video-annotation-app.py`.


## Features (Planned)
- Multi-user and multi-project management
- Video upload and frame extraction
- Interactive annotation with bounding boxes
- Per-frame annotation persistence (COCO JSON, PASCAL VOC XML)
- Model training and export
- Download/export of annotated data

*This is a scaffold. Please upload or request initial files to begin development.*
